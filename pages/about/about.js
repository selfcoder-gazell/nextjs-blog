              <p>I dived into the world of web development out of blue. 
              A friend suggested for me to take the leap in 2022.
              I discarded his idea immediatelly. </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
              My idea of software developer was mainly about spending days/weeks without speaking to a soul in front of a screen(s).
              That's SAD, right? LONELY...</p>
              <p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
              I started to explore the field of web development little bit more and guess what?
              I was so wrong!! 
              </p>
                <br></br>
              I am a social creature. 
              I need to work with people I could call my second family.
              </p>
         <br></br>
         <p>When I came across School of Code (FREE of charge) I could not belive my luck. 
              My attempt to be accepted into the School of Code - FAILED (Jan.2023). 
              It is scary to change a career at any age and I felt excatly that.
              Fear of change, faillure, shame ... exc. IMPOSTER SYNDROM written all over.</p>
              <br></br>
              I applied again and I got accepted (Sep.2023) - SUCCESS at last. 
              Along with 90odd others (Out of more than 3000 applications) we delved straght into full-stack technologies.
              
              <p><br></br>It felt as i was being a traveler in a foreign country without a map. 
              Feelings of disorientation at first, but as I explored and learned, 
              I started to recognize landmarsk, understand the language, and find my way around. 
                </p>
                <p>I am still finding my way now .... but now I got a MAP :-)  </p>
