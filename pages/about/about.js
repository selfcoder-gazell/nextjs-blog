              <p>Diving headfirst into the world of software development was a decision born out of curiosity and a nudge from a friend back in 2022.
              I dismissed the idea, imagining a solitary existence glued to screens for endless hours - a prospect that felt isolating and disheartening.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
              But as I delved deeper into  he field, I discovered that I was wrong, soo.. wrong!
              As a social creature, I craved connections and collaboration, seeking a work environment similar to a second family.
              </p>
         <br></br>
         <p>I have been lost in the ocean of information and the amount of coding languages I could choose from. 
            When I came across School of Code I could not believe my luck. 
              My attempt to be accepted into the School of Code in January 2023 FAILED. 
              It is scary to change a career at any age and I felt exactly that.
              Fear of change, failure, shame ... ect. IMPOSTER SYNDROM written all over.</p>
              <br></br>
              I applied again and I got accepted in September 2023 - SUCCESS at last. 
              Along with 90 like-minded individuals selected from a pool of over 3000 applications, 
              we delved straight into full-stack technologies.
              
              <p><br></br>It felt as i was being a traveller in a foreign country without a map. 
              Feelings of disorientation at first, but as I explored and learned, 
              I started to recognize landmarks, understand the language, and find my way around. 
                </p>
                <p>I am still finding my way .... but now I got a MAP :-)  </p>
