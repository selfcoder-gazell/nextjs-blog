              I never quite knew what i wanted to do as a job in my life. 
              It was easier to work out what I did not want to do. 
              I was gradually working out what parts of different jobs I enjoy. 
              I dive into the world of web development out of blue. 
              Friend of mine suggestion came from nowhere(2022).
              I discarded his/her idea immediatelly. 
              My image of a web/software developer was (like many other's) wrong. 
              I was imagining it as spending days/weeks without speaking to a soul in front of a screen(s).
              That's SAD, right? LONELY... I am a social creature. 
              I need to work with people i can call my second family.
              I started to explore the field of web development little bit more and gues what?
              I was wrong?? 
              When I came across School of Code (free of charge) I could not belive my luck. 
              My first attempt to be accepted into the School of Code - FAILED (Jan.2023). 
              It is scary to change a career at any age and I felt excatly that.
              Fear of change, faillure, shame ... exc. IMPOSTER SYNDROM written all over. 
              I applied again and I got accepted (Sep.2023) - SUCCESS at last. 
              Along with 90odd others (Out of more than 3000 applications).
